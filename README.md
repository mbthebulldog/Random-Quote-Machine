# Random-Quote-Machine
This is a [simple interactive webpage](http://jsbin.com/hovovop/1) that is at first nothing but a mysterious button which, when pushed, repeatedly displays a random quote and allows the user to tweet that quote.

I created this webpage as part of the curriculum at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/mbthebulldog).
